I am Dou Xingxiang, a front-end developer working at a webgame company based on Shanghai. 

Currently I use ActionScript for flash developing, and do some little work using Python. Now I find Markdown really great for writing docs, blogs etc. I am studying AVM2 and have completed some paraphrases from Adobe's official document into Simplified Chinese. 

Jekyll is an awesome tool. After finishing the guide of Jekyll, a few new technology terms are pushed into the stack for learning, YAML, CoffeeScript, Sass, Textile, and Liquid templating language. A lot of work!
