Open source has been a movement for about two decades, but people always have a desire to share amazing stuff, to work with talented peers, to help the ones who have trouble in solving some problem. 

The big success of open source movement have largely due to the Internet, especially WWW. The network has made collaboration and communication ever convenient, IM, email, even video chatting. The community is never been greater, think about it, once you have a good idea, or encounter some tricky trouble, a whole world of more talented, experienced, professional fellows are willing to providing efforts.

People who have been in open source spend tremendous time and effort dealing with fundamental codes for providing valuable libraries, frameworks without charging. Why people offering to do this?

As mentioned above, people always have a desire to share, to help someone else, to make life and the world more beautiful. As people are inspired and motivated by others, more and more people are in. A big community comes into being, the movement will be running ever after.
